![lanOS - Diskless computer deployment and management](lanOS-banner.png)

---

Desktop deployment is time-consuming and costly. With lanOS, computers in public environments such as computer labs no longer need to be provisioned and managed individually. lanOS can assign a single virtual disk to multiple targets and all modifications to files, installed programs and registry keys will be discarded at shutdown or reboot, effectively rendering the system read-only and secure to all modifications.

Being diskless means that hard drive reliability for every system is no longer a cause for concern. Because Operating System and user files do not reside on the machine, the need for reliable storage hardware and expensive and complex backup solutions is decreased to only one server machine. In case of hardware failure, the virtual disk can be remapped to another target, without the need for reinstallation or migration of user data.

Built with simplicity in mind, lanOS is managed by a Windows Admin Center extension powered by modern web technologies such as Angular and HTML5. Its easy-to-use web interface means that there is no need to hire additional staff to manage lanOS. Everything is meticulously labeled and rigorously documented such that getting started with lanOS is as painless as possible.
